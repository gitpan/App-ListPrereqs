  list_prereqs(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    Currently skips prerequisites which are modules already in core (for
    installed perl version).

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   module* => *array*

        Perl module(s) to check.

    *   raw => *bool* (default: 0)

        Return raw result.

    *   recursive => *bool* (default: 0)

        Whether to check recursively.

    Return value:

    Returns an enveloped result (an array). First element (status) is an
    integer containing HTTP status code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx
    function error). Second element (msg) is a string containing error
    message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third element (result) is optional,
    the actual result. Fourth element (meta) is called result metadata and
    is optional, a hash that contains extra information.
